# LiveSRM
A software package for analyzing live cell super resolution microscopy data.



Installation

For users with git installed:

The following command will give the user a clone of the repository:
$ git clone https://github.com/cisselab/LiveSRM.git 

The user should then add LiveSRM to the MATLAB search path



For other users:

The software can also be obtained by downloading the zip from https://github.com/cisselab/LiveSRM/archive/master.zip

The software should be unzipped, and added to the MATLAB search path. 


Pair Correlation Analysis

For the pair correlation analysis, our software makes use of code developed by another group. The function get_autocorr is made available in the publication cited below. The code should be downloaded, renamed as get_autocorr.m and added to the MATLAB search path.
